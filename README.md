# Debian12-DraculaTheme-Autosetup
An automatic installer for the Dracula Theme in Debian 12 with GNOME desktop environment

## What is it? ##
I happen to like the Dracula Theme from Eliver Lara (available on gnomelook dot org), and I wanted an auto-installer for that theme for a fresh install of Debian in the future.

## Prerequisites ##
You will need a local user with `sudo` privileges, and the Gnome Tweaks and Shell Extensions. The installer will check first if both of these are installed; if not, it will install them. You may be prompted to input your password from time to time.
